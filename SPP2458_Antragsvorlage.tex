% Note that for the SPP we have the following: 
%
%  Each proposal must be accompanied by a description of how the project is integral to the
%  Priority Programme, both in terms of subject matter and organisation. This includes a descrip-
%  tion of the cooperation with others participating within the Priority Programme. The envisaged
%  realisation of the project in cooperation with other applicants may be demonstrated in particular
%  by the joint training of early career researchers, or the use of methods by multiple projects as
%  part of a network.
%  All applicants involved in submitting a proposal within an established Priority Programme are
%  obliged to promptly provide the overall coordinator with all of the information necessary for
%  drawing up the interim reports and the final report for the Priority Programme.
